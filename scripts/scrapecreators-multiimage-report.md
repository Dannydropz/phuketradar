## API Response Structure

- No `images` array

### Available Fields (All Posts)

- `text` - Post content
- `url` - Post permalink
- `author` - Author details (name, id)
- `image` - Primary image URL
- `images` - **Array of all images (if multi-image post)** ⭐

- `commentCount` - Number of comments
- `publishTime` - Unix timestamp
- `topComments` - Top comments on the post

## Cost Comparison: Final Decision

### ScrapeCreators (RECOMMENDED ✅)
- **Cost**: $3.38/month (60 requests/day @ $47 for 25k credits)
- **Multi-image**: ✅ NOW SUPPORTED!
- **Pricing model**: Pay per page scrape
- **Your usage**: ~60 requests/day = 1,800/month

### BrightData (Not Needed ❌)
- **Cost**: $27/month (18k records @ $1.50 per 1k)
- **Multi-image**: ✅ Supported
- **Pricing model**: Pay per post returned
- **Your usage**: ~18,000 records/month

### Cost Savings
**Monthly**: $23.62 saved by staying with ScrapeCreators  
**Annual**: $283.44 saved

## Implementation Update Needed

### Current Schema (Already Correct! ✅)
```typescript
export interface ScrapedPost {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  imageUrl?: string;      // Single image
  imageUrls?: string[];   // Multi-image array ← Already exists!
  sourceUrl: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
}
```

Your schema already has `imageUrls` array - perfect!

### Mapping Update Required

Update `server/services/scraper.ts` to use the new `images` field:

**Current mapping (single image only):**
```typescript
imageUrl: post.image || post.full_picture
```

**New mapping (multi-image support):**
```typescript
imageUrl: post.image || post.full_picture,
imageUrls: post.images && post.images.length > 0 
  ? post.images 
  : (post.image ? [post.image] : [])
```

This ensures:
- Multi-image posts get all images in `imageUrls` array
- Single-image posts still work (wrap single image in array)
- Backward compatible with existing code
