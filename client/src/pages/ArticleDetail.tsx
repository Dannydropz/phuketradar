    title: "Major Development Plans Announced for Phuket International Airport",
    content: `
      <p>The Phuket Airport Authority has unveiled comprehensive expansion plans that will transform the island's main gateway into one of Southeast Asia's premier aviation hubs. The ambitious project, estimated at 15 billion baht, aims to increase passenger capacity by 50% over the next five years.</p>

      <p>Airport Director Thanee Chuangchoo announced the plans at a press conference today, highlighting several key components of the development. "This expansion is crucial for Phuket's continued growth as a world-class tourist destination," he stated. "We're not just adding capacityâ€”we're reimagining the entire passenger experience."</p>

      <h2>Key Features of the Expansion</h2>

      <p>The development includes construction of a new international terminal building spanning 150,000 square meters, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and sustainable design features. The terminal will house 24 additional boarding gates, premium lounges, and an expanded duty-free shopping area.</p>

      <p>Infrastructure improvements will also extend to the airfield, with plans for two additional taxiways and upgraded runway lighting systems to enhance operational efficiency and safety. The cargo handling area will be expanded to accommodate growing freight demands, particularly for seafood and agricultural exports.</p>

      <h2>Impact on Tourism</h2>

      <p>Tourism industry leaders have welcomed the announcement, noting that airport capacity has been a limiting factor during peak seasons. The Tourism Authority of Thailand projects that the expansion could support an additional 5 million international arrivals annually once completed.</p>

      <p>Local businesses anticipate significant economic benefits from increased visitor numbers. Hotel associations report strong booking trends for the upcoming high season, with many properties already at capacity for major holidays.</p>

      <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>

      <p>The airport authority has committed to incorporating green building standards throughout the project. Solar panels will be installed on terminal roofs, rainwater harvesting systems will reduce water consumption, and energy-efficient cooling systems will minimize environmental impact.</p>

      <p>Construction is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2026, with phased completion planned to minimize disruption to current operations. The first phase, focusing on the new terminal building, is expected to be operational by late 2028.</p>
