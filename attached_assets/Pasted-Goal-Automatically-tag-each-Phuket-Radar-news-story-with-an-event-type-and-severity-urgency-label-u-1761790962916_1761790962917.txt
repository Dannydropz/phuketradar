Goal:
Automatically tag each Phuket Radar news story with an event type and severity/urgency label using the OpenAI GPT-5 nano API for minimal cost.

1. Update Article Schema
Add these fields to your articles table/model:

event_type (string/text, e.g. Accident, Crime, Weather, Health, Public Order, Tourism, Other)

severity (string/text, e.g. High Alert, Developing, Minor, Info Only)

2. Integrate Classification in Pipeline
After collecting/translating each new story (and before publishing), call the OpenAI API with the GPT-5 nano model:

javascript
const prompt = `
Classify this Phuket news story for event type and severity.

STORY:
"${storyText}"

Return in JSON: {"event_type": "...", "severity": "..."}

Categories: Accident, Crime, Weather, Health, Public Order, Tourism, Other.
Severity: High Alert, Developing, Minor, Info Only.
`;

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-nano',       // Use GPT-5 nano for lowest cost
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
});

const tags = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);

article.event_type = tags.event_type;
article.severity = tags.severity;
Save these values to the database record for the story.

3. Display in UI and Use for Filtering
Show event_type and severity as badges, filters, or highlights wherever you list/push news stories.

Optionally, use these for push notifications or special “Breaking” banners.

4. Cost Optimization
Use GPT-5 nano only for classification tagging. It’s much cheaper than GPT-4o mini (as little as $0.05–$0.25 per 1M tokens).

Only classify new/unique stories, not drafts or duplicates.

If possible, keep story text short (headline and main bullet only) for the prompt—the shorter, the cheaper.

Summary:

Update schema: add event_type and severity.

For every new story, call OpenAI GPT-5 nano with a classification prompt.

Store and display the tags.

This setup gives you advanced news tagging and smart filtering for almost zero added monthly cost!
