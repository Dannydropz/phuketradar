Depth Update Workflow
1. Update Article Pipeline Design
Requirement: Detect when additional details for an existing breaking news article become available.

Action: Instead of publishing a new article, update the body of the existing story.

Fetch latest details from designated news sources.

Add a visible timestamp or "Updated" line at the top.

Optionally append update logs at the end of the article for transparency.

2. Multi-source Aggregation
Task: Expand the source base by integrating these English-language Phuket news sites:

The Phuket News [https://www.thephuketnews.com/news-phuket.php](https://www.thephuketnews.com/news-phuket.php)

The Phuket Express [https://thephuketexpress.com/](https://thephuketexpress.com/)

The Thaiger [https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket](https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket)

Action: Treat each of these as "official" sources for details extraction and fact-checking.

Continue using Thai sources as before.

Flag articles as "English" or "Thai" sourced for easy tracking and multilingual cross-referencing.

3. Automated Depth Enhancement Steps
For each breaking news post:

On a fixed schedule (e.g., hourly), scan the English/Thai sources for keywords or story matches.

If new details or facts are found:

Extract and summarize in plain English.

Update the existing post’s body with a new section, prefaced with "Update: [timestamp]".

Optionally, highlight official statements, police info, or new eyewitness reports.

Log which source provided the update in the article metadata for transparency and traceability.

4. Editorial Customization
Allow manual editor intervention on each update:

Editors can review source extracts, rewrite for clarity/plain English, and select which details to publish.

Editors can trigger a manual “Insight” analysis as a separate short-form feature for major stories.

Implementation Tips:

Use scraping pipelines and NLP for cross-linking story topics across English and Thai feeds.

Add source URLs and update timestamps in the CMS database for visibility.

Provide a simple dashboard alert when new updates are available for any existing story.

Summary for the agent & dev team:
"Continuously monitor listed English and Thai news sources for incremental updates on Phuket stories. Automatically or manually refresh existing articles in-place, marking updates visibly, and log sources and times for transparency. New longform or insight pieces can be published as needed for big stories or analyses."
