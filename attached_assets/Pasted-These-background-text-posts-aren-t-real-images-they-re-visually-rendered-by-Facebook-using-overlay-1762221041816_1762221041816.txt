These "background text" posts aren't real images—they're visually rendered by Facebook using overlays, backgrounds, or sometimes SVG/canvas on the frontend.

When scraping, the image associated with these posts is typically a small or low-res file, often with a single color (black, red, blue, etc.), and doesn't contain any real photo content.

Posts with photo uploads will be associated with a real (multi-color, non-uniform) image.

How to filter programmatically:

Check for text post attributes:
On the API or in DOM extraction, posts with solid color backgrounds often have a type, property, or style class that denotes "background text" (sometimes data-testid="status-attachment-background" or similar).
If scraping HTML, look for divs or spans with inline background style/color and no actual <img> tag for the intended media.

Analyze the image (if scraping rendered image):

Solid color detection: Use an image-processing step to check if the image is a single color (or >99% pixels are the same value).

Image size check: Facebook's solid color backgrounds are frequently small in dimension or very low file size (e.g., under 10kB).

No EXIF data: Images generated by Facebook backgrounds usually have no EXIF/camera metadata.

Use Vision API/OCR as fallback:
If the image is solid color and contains no visible text when run through OCR, it's likely a background text post.
For actual photos, OCR may pick up scene details or multiple colored regions.

Sample logic (pseudo-code):

python
if is_solid_color(image) and image_size < threshold and not has_exif(image):
    # Likely a color background text post, filter it out
else:
    # Legit image or photo, keep it
DOM Approach:
When scraping Facebook, look for posts with the background-color class but without an attached photo/media node.

Summary of practical approach:

Check image uniformity (solid color test)

Apply size threshold filter (e.g., under 10–15kB)

Look for presence/absence of real photo EXIF (if downloaded)

Optionally, check parent post type/class in the DOM for background post markers
